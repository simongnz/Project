# Project Platformer game C++
Platformer game like mario style, still work in progress. If sprite does not load check for the image directory(still working on it). Uses SMFL 
library and classes from C++ to create the game. Collision works at the bottom of the screen with right and left movement working perfectly fine. 
Jump needs work to limit the jump as well to make the character go down by itself. Skeletal class was build for tiles and the map.
